# K Nearest Neighbours
K-Nearest Neighbor( kNN) is a non- parametric algorithm which is used for classification as
well as density estimation. Since kNN is non-parametric, it can perform density estimation
for arbitrary distributions and unlike other parametric methods, here no knowledge of
distribution is required beforehand. Also, there is no explicit training phase in this
algorithmand all the training data is needed during the testing phase. If the data size is huge,it
becomes computationally expensive.
The aim is to find the k closest neighbours of a test sample in terms of distance between them
in the feature space and increase the volume centered on the sample till it accommodates all
the ki nearest neighbours.
